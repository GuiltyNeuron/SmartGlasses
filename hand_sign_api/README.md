# :ok_hand: Hand Sign API

## Introduction
This API is responsible of detecting human hand then recognise the sign if exists.
For the detection, we are going to train one of those model : Faster RCNN, SSD or YOLO.
And for the recognition, we are going to use and train a CNN model.

## Results
##### CNN sign classifier training :
